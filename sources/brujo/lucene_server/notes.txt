- The goals:
	- To show you how to connect to seemingly incompatible worlds to get the best of them
	- How we started with a very specific problem and end up with a very general solution

- The story
	- TigerText offered AC
	- It took data from Redis
	- It was implemented in Erlang using ETS tables
	- Java offered Lucene

- The project
	- Our mission: To connect both worlds
	- Our tools: Jinterface

- The steps:
	- Just OTP on top of Jinterface
	- The stub autocomplete server
	- Adding Lucene to the picture
	- Removing the stub

- The result
	- A Java Erlang node that processes AC calls

- Can we improve on that?
	- Indeed
	- Now we have a very basic Lucene Node, that lets you
		- Add documents ([{atom(), string()}])
		- Del documents based on a query
		- Query documents Lucene-style

- What's next?
	- Extend!
